Thanks for trying my asset pack!
This is pack 2 of 2.
This is probably the last update on this set.

these pieces have all been tested to fit properly, although some of the texture seams are not perfect they work pretty well.(Substance painter does not like modular assets!)
for proper fitting, set unity snap settings to 3 in all axes, or a number evenly divisible by 3 then remember to hold Ctrl and drag pieces into place.(or just do what works for you!)

please leave any questions or comments on the forum for this asset! thanks :)
